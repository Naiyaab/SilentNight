Code Test for Silent Night

If i had the time to properly code this static page, i would have done the following:

- Make sure the page is resposnsive across all devices and monitors.
- I would have added a function to the gallery script where when you click on to the image it opens up a lightbox and you're able to see the mattress image up close.
- The CSS could have been refractored in to SCSS & SASS using Grunt just to organise the style sheet and make the style changes easier to make.
- The page could have been tested throughly and been approached via an agile, this would have allowed me to add responsiveness and SASS to the build.

It might not be the best but i am still learning and improving, i would have loved to have completed this with sass but i didnt want to delay the test any further.
