Code Test for Silent Night

If i had the time to properly code this static page, i would have done the following:

- Make sure the page is resposnsive across all devices and monitors.
- I would have added a function to the gallery script where when you click on to the image it opens up a lightbox and you're able to see the mattress image up close.
- The CSS would have been refractored in to SCSS & SASS using Grunt just to organise the style sheet and make the style changes easier to make.
- The page could have been tested throughly and been approached via an agile, this would have allowed me to add responsiveness and SASS to the build.
